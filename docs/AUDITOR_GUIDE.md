# Auditor Guide — AuditExport

This document explains how to review and validate
evidence generated by AuditExport.

---

## Evidence Philosophy

AuditExport generates:
- Raw technical evidence (GitHub APIs)
- Structured summaries
- Human-readable control assertions

It does NOT:
- Interpret audit results
- Certify compliance
- Replace auditor judgment

---

## Folder Guide

### `github/`
Raw evidence collected directly from GitHub.
Examples:
- repositories.json
- pull_requests.json
- workflow_runs.json

This data is immutable and timestamped.

---

### `summaries/`
Auditor-facing interpretations and indexes.
Examples:
- executive_summary.txt
- soc2_change_management_assertions.txt
- soc2_control_mapping.json

These explain HOW evidence supports controls.

---

### `run/`
Execution metadata:
- execution_log.txt
- run_metadata.json
- hashes.txt

Use hashes to verify integrity.

---

## SOC 2 Review Flow

1. Open `soc2_change_management_assertions.txt`
2. Review stated control assertions
3. Cross-check with:
   - `github/pull_requests.json`
   - `github/workflows/workflow_runs.json`
4. Validate file integrity via `run/hashes.txt`
5. Use `soc2_control_mapping.json` for navigation

---

## Skipped or Missing Evidence

If a control is unavailable (e.g. CI not enabled):
- It is explicitly marked as skipped
- No placeholder or fabricated evidence is created

This is an intentional and valid audit state.

---

## Integrity Verification

To verify integrity:
1. Calculate SHA-256 hash of any file
2. Compare with `run/hashes.txt`
3. Any mismatch indicates modification

---

## Reproducibility

Re-running AuditExport with the same inputs
regenerates the same structure with new timestamps.

---

## Conclusion

AuditExport provides **verifiable technical evidence**.
Final audit conclusions remain the responsibility of the auditor.
