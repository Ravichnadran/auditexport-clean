# SECURITY STATEMENT – AuditExport

Last updated: 2025-01-XX

This document describes how **AuditExport** handles security, data access, and execution.

AuditExport is designed to meet the expectations of **security auditors**, **compliance teams**, and **risk assessors**.

---

## 1. Execution Model

* AuditExport runs **entirely on the user’s local machine**
* No cloud services, background agents, or remote execution
* No outbound network connections except to explicitly configured platforms (e.g., GitHub API)

There is **no server-side component**.

---

## 2. Data Handling

AuditExport:

* Does **not collect**, **store**, or **transmit** user data externally
* Writes evidence **only to the local filesystem**
* Never uploads audit data to AuditExport or third parties

All generated evidence remains under the user’s control.

---

## 3. Credentials & Secrets

* Credentials (e.g., GitHub tokens) are provided **by the user**
* Tokens are read from environment variables or local configuration
* Tokens are **never logged**, persisted, or embedded in output files

AuditExport does **not** manage secrets on behalf of the user.

---

## 4. CI/CD Evidence Collection (SOC 2)

When CI/CD evidence is enabled:

* Only **metadata** is collected
* Evidence includes:

  * Workflow existence
  * Workflow configuration files
  * Trigger conditions (PR, merge, push)
  * Execution history (timestamps, status)

AuditExport **does not** collect:

* Build logs
* Artifacts
* Secrets values
* Runtime environment variables

---

## 5. Principle of Least Privilege

AuditExport requires **read-only access** to supported platforms.

Recommended permissions:

* GitHub: `repo:read`, `org:read`, `actions:read`

The Tool does not perform:

* Writes
* Mutations
* Configuration changes
* Administrative actions

---

## 6. Tamper Resistance & Integrity

* Evidence is written in structured, human-readable formats (JSON, TXT)
* Hashes are generated for all evidence files
* Evidence bundles are zipped after collection
* Hash verification enables post-run integrity validation

---

## 7. Audit Transparency

AuditExport is intentionally designed so that:

* All collected evidence is visible
* No hidden processing occurs
* Auditors can trace:

  * What was collected
  * When it was collected
  * From which source

This supports **audit defensibility**.

---

## 8. Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

* Do **not** publicly disclose it
* Report responsibly to:

[security@auditexport.com](mailto:security@auditexport.com)

Include:

* Description of the issue
* Steps to reproduce
* Potential impact

---

## 9. Scope Clarification

AuditExport is **not**:

* A security scanner
* A penetration testing tool
* A vulnerability assessment platform
* A certification authority

It is an **evidence automation utility**.

---

## 10. Compliance Alignment

AuditExport supports evidence collection relevant to:

* ISO/IEC 27001
* SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria)

Final compliance decisions remain the responsibility of the organization and its auditor.
